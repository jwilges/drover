## Background
This utility aims to provide a simple, repeatable, and efficient process for
deploying a Python package as a Lambda.

To encourage separating infrequently changing Python dependencies in a separate
"requirements" layer, by default `drover` requires a list of regular expressions
to define which files to include in the Lambda function; all other files are
placed in a requirements layer that is then attached to the Lambda function.

Next, `drover` generates and stores hashes for both the Lambda function and the
requirements layer. This allows `drover` to avoid redundantly updating the
Lambda function and/or requirements layer if no package contents have changed.

As much as possible, `drover` avoids altering existing infrastructure.
Infrastructure utilities such as
[Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform) may be used to create a
Lambda and manage its surrounding resources and `drover` may be used to update
the Lambda function as well as its layers.

## Supported Platforms
This utility is continuously unit tested on a GNU/Linux system with Python 3.6,
3.7, and 3.8.

## Usage
### Settings
The following `drover.yml` settings file demonstrates how to configure a
`staging` stage that may be used to deploy a Python package to a Lambda named
`basic-lambda` in the `us-east-1` region:

```yaml
stages:
  staging:
    region_name: us-east-1
    function_name: basic-lambda
    compatible_runtime: python3.8
    function_file_patterns:
      - '^basic_lambda.*'
    function_extra_paths:
      - instance
    upload_bucket:
      region_name: us-east-1
      bucket_name: drover-examples
```

The `compatible_runtime` value will be used to define the compatible runtime for
both the requirements layer (if present) and the Lambda function.

While processing files from the install path (see: `--install-path` below), any
files matching regular expressions defined in the `function_file_patterns` list
will be included in the function; any remaining files will be included in the
requirements layer.

The `function_extra_paths` list may contain additional paths to include in the
function layer archive; non-absolute paths will be relative to the current
working directory.

The `upload_bucket` map may provide a S3 Bucket name and its associated region
for use when uploading Lambda function and layer archive files.

### Command line interface
Assuming a Python package exists in the `basic_lambda` directory, the following
commands demonstrate a simple Lambda deploy with `drover`:

    pip install --target install basic_lambda
    drover --install-path install staging

Assuming the Lambda is not already up to date, `drover` will attempt to upload
the latest source and update the Lambda function:

    Requirements digest: None
    Function digest: 0b37cf78f6ad4c137fb1f77751c0c0e759dd2d6c515937d33fae435b9e091f72
    Skipping requirements upload
    Uploading function archive...
    Failed to upload function archive to bucket; falling back to direct file upload.
    Updating function resource...
    Updated function "basic-lambda" resource; size: 1.78 KiB; ARN: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:977874552542:function:basic-lambda

## How to contribute
Contributions are welcome in the form of inquiries, issues, and pull requests.

### Development Environment
Initialize a development environment by executing `nox -s dev-3.8`; the `drover`
utility will be installed in the `.nox/dev-3-8` Python virtual environment
binary path.
